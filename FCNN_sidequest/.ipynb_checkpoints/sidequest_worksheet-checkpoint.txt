I am going to take an incredibly brief detour to try a merged fully-connected NN because... I haven't. And I am curious if it will work. lol. 

I am uploading an older code (but it still checks out) from my FCNN on PVU/GPH from before AGU. 
I will modify this to match the needs of my current architecture. 

The immediate firt-pass of this is ... strangely promising? 
Like, there's actually probablitiy distributions out to 0 and 1. The distribution is more along the lines of "normal", bell curve.
As it stands, this is just a 14-day prediction. No timeseries. 

...
I am insulted. LOL. 
This works!!! Somehow better than the LSTM?
I want to poke at this model a little bit more to see if I can make conclusions about what it is actually looking at. 

I did start conducting hyperparameter tuning just out of, like, pure curiosity.

Okay so what was out of "curiosity" may devolve into a full change of plans depending on what the CV looks like + forecast of opportunity plots. lol. 
I am going to do the CV today for assessment because my curiosity plagues me. 


I am going back in to make sure my data is offset correctly. 
I think it is, but I need to check myself. (I was fine)

CV added in. 
Also added in LRP. I will make a file to look at those + composites.
